# Executive Summary: AI-Governance & Cyber-Physical Integrity Framework

## 1. The Problem: The "Black Box" Risk
Current AI-assisted software engineering (using LLMs like GPT-4 or Claude) suffers from "Architectural Slop"—the tendency for AI to generate non-standard, un-auditable, and physically impossible code. In industrial contexts, this leads to catastrophic system failure and unmaintainable technical debt.

## 2. The Innovation: Deterministic Intercept & Physical Invariants
This project establishes a novel methodology for AI oversight by implementing two primary innovations:
- **Physics-Based Data Validation:** A deterministic layer that cross-references AI-generated telemetry against physical constants (e.g., Torque/Power/Heat correlations), automatically rejecting "Ghost Signals" or hallucinations.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Governance:** A pre-commit audit engine that intercepts non-compliant code and mandates a timestamped "Expert Justification" for architectural deviations.

## 3. Impact & Evidence of Extraordinary Ability
This framework moves beyond "using AI" and enters the realm of **"Governing AI."** - **Original Contribution:** The 15-Rule Invariant Set is a proprietary standard for clean AI-human collaboration.
- **Critical Role:** As the Senior Engineer, I developed the enforcement scripts (`governance-check.mjs`) and the physics simulation logic (`mock-factory.ts`).
- **Verifiable Audit:** The `OVERRIDE_LOG.md` serves as a permanent record of professional judgment, a requirement for high-reliability software sectors.

## 4. Conclusion
This work serves as a benchmark for how senior engineers can leverage AI while maintaining 100% accountability, safety, and architectural integrity in complex system design.
