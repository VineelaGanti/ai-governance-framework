# AI Governance & Cyber-Physical Integrity Framework
**A Research-Led Implementation for Governed AI Software Engineering**

## 🎯 Research Thesis
As Large Language Models (LLMs) become central to software development, they introduce "Architectural Slop" and "Data Hallucinations." This project demonstrates a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Governance Layer** that enforces structural invariants and physical reality constraints on AI-generated industrial telemetry.

## 🛠️ Key Innovation 1: Deterministic Physics Engine
Unlike standard simulations that use random "Vibe Data," this framework implements a **Cyber-Physical Validation Layer** in `@/lib/mock-factory.ts`. 

- **Physical Invariants:** Enforces mathematical correlations between motor speed, power consumption, and thermal dissipation ($P \propto \omega^2$).
- **Integrity Judge:** A validation engine that detects and rejects "Ghost Signals"—physically impossible data points generated by LLM hallucinations.

## ⚖️ Key Innovation 2: Automated Governance Engine
To maintain architectural integrity, the project utilizes a custom **Audit Engine** (`scripts/governance-check.mjs`) that enforces a proprietary 15-Rule Invariant Set.

### The Intercept Protocol:
1. **Detection:** Automated scanning for architectural drift (e.g., violations of Rule #7: Named Exports, or Rule #10: Nested Ternaries).
2. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Reasoning:** Rather than a silent failure, the system intercepts the developer and requires a **Signed Technical Justification** to override governance rules.
3. **Auditability:** All expert justifications are timestamped and recorded in `OVERRIDE_LOG.md`, creating a verifiable record of professional judgment.
