# Rules for AI

1. **Strict Type Safety:** Never use any. If a type is unknown, use unknown. Use Zod to validate all external API responses.

2. **No Boolean Flags:** Avoid isLoading or isError. Use Discriminated Unions (e.g., status: 'loading' | 'success' | 'error').

3. **Component Limits:** No single component file may exceed 150 lines. Logic exceeding 20 lines must be moved to a custom hook.

4. **Semantic HTML Only:** Never use a div for an action; use button. Never use span for headings.

5. **Absolute Imports:** Use @/components/... instead of relative paths like ../../components/....

6. **Functional Mastery:** Prefer functional and declarative patterns. Avoid classes and this entirely.

7. **Named Exports:** Use named exports for all components and utilities. No export default.

8. **Error Perimeter:** Every asynchronous component must be wrapped in a custom <ErrorBoundary />.

9. **Tailored Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively. Avoid custom CSS files or inline style objects.

10. **Early Returns:** Use guard clauses to return early. Never use an else block after an if that returns.

11. **Deterministic Naming:** Prefix all event handlers with handle (e.g., handleClick, handleInputChange).

12. **Zero-Duplicate Logic:** If the same logic appears twice, it must be extracted into a helper or service.

13. **Explicit Dependencies:** All useEffect or useMemo hooks must have a fully populated dependency array. No "cheating" with // eslint-disable-line.

14. **Accessibility (A11y):** All interactive elements must have aria-label and tabIndex.

15. **No Placeholders:** Never leave TODO, FIXME, or // ... logic here comments. The code must be 100% complete.
